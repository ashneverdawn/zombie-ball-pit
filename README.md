# zombie-ball-pit

The game is currently a work in progress.

Once implemented, the player will control one of the balls and try to survive a zombie infection outbreak for as long as possible. Score will be tracked and compared to best score from previous runs.

This game is an experiment made with amethyst. Feel free to use this as a learning resource. :)
